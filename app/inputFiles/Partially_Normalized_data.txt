PMID	18445495__1	Notably , the defect of synaptic vesicle endocytosis by altered LRRK2 expression was largely rescued by co-expression of both wild type and constitutively active Rab5b proteins , but not by its dominant negative form ( REF_Figs. 6_ENDREF A and C ) , further supporting the notion that LRRK2 and Rab5b co-operatively regulate endocytosis .	1.2530
